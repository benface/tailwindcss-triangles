## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-04-07

### Added
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility

### Changed
- Moved the `triangles` config option to the `theme` object in your Tailwind config
- Flattened `defaultOptions` and split it into the `defaultSize` and `defaultColor` options
- Removed the default `direction`, it has to be set explicitly for each triangle now
- The default `height` cannot be customized anymore; a triangleâ€™s height is now always half its `size` by default, or it can be customized per triangle
- Renamed the `prefix` option to `componentPrefix`
